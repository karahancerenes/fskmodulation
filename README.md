 In this project, Frequency Hopping Frequency-Shift Keying (FSK) method is used for sending audio information. During receiving and transmitting, laptop's loudspeaker and microphone are used. In FSK modulation, each symbol is transmitted with a different tone of frequency.
 
 There are 4 Matlab .m file in this repository and there is a report for describing the project.
 
 At the beginning, the receiver doesn't know which character corresponds which frequency. I send a test signal to the receiver in order to introduce carrier frequencies. Then, the receiver learns the carrier frequencies and it is able to determine characters by sound.
